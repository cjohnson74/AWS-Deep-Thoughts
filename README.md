# AWS-Deep-Thoughts
In this application, I refactored the existing MERN application Deep Thoughts, which allows users to sign up and create an account, post their thoughts, and share their thoughts and images with other users. I deployed this app to the cloud using AWS and replace the back-end API to use cloud resources for storage, database, and computing. To accomplish this, I configured a database service with DynamoDB, stored and retrieved static assets using S3, and deployed the app on an Ubuntu server to an EC2 instance.
